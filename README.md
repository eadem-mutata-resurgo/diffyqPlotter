# diffyqPlotter
Plots 3D systems of ordinary differential equations as a projection onto the XY-plane.

diffyQPlotterFast does not clear and redraw the canvas every frame, and thus can draw much faster without performance issues, but has slightly limited functionality. Useful to draw trajectories over longer time frames.
